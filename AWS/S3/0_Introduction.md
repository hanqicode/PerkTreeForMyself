## Concepts

### Buckets
A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3.

### Objects
Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. 

Objects consist of object data and metadata.
- The data portion is opaque to Amazon S3.
- The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object.
 
An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID.
 
### Keys
A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. 

The combination of a bucket, key, and version ID uniquely identify each object.

### Regions
You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements.
