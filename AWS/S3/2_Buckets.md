# Buckets

## Name
An Amazon S3 bucket name is globally unique, and the namespace is shared by all AWS accounts. 
This means that after a bucket is created, the name of that bucket cannot be used by another AWS account in any AWS Region 
until the bucket is deleted.

## Bucket Restrictions and Limitations
By default, you can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts.
