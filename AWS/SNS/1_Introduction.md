## What is SNS?
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that 
coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients. 

Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by producing and sending a message to a topic, 
which is a logical access point and communication channel.

Subscribers:
1. Lambda
2. SQS
3. HTTP/S
4. Email
5. SMS
