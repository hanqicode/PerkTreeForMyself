# Git Message

[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

Here is a template I use:

```
Subject line (less than 50 characters) 

Detailed description (less than 72 characters) (What)
details
details
details

SIM: https://issues.amazon.com/issues/CDP-1234 (Why)

cr https://code.amazon.com/reviews/CR-123456789
```

Tips:
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line.
2. Capitalize the subject line: `Subject line` instead of `subject line`.
3. Do NOT end the subject line with a period: `Subject line` instead of `Subject line.`
