## What is The Shell?
The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out.

Terminal Emulator looks like: `[me@linuxbox ~]$ `. Let's try some simple commands.

`date`: displays the current time and date.

`cal`(calendar): displays a calendar of current month.

`df(disk filesystem)`: to see current amount of free space on your disk drivers.
