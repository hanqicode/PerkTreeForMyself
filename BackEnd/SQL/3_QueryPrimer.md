# Query Primer

## Query Mechanics
Once the server has verified your username and password, it will generate a **database connection**.

Once the server has verified you and issued you a connection, you are ready to execute queries. The server will do 3 pre-checks:
1. Do you have the permission to execute the statement?
2. Do you have the permission to access the desired data?
3. Is you statement syntax correct?

Then the **query optimizer** will determine the most efficient way to execute your query.
