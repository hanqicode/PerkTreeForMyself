# Adapter

## What is Adapter?
Now I have a macbook with interface Thunderbolt2. I have a monitor and its interface(cable) is Thunderbolt2. 
I can extend successfully.

Now I want to extend/change another monitor but its interface(cable) is HDMI. 
We cannot plugin HDMI cable to macbook's Thunderbolt2 interface directly.

Then we need an adapter to 
1. accept input HDMI
2. output an interface to Thunderbolt2.

Picture like below:
