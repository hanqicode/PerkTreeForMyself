# Builder Design Pattern

## What is Builder pattern?
It is same like Lombok's `@Builder`. [Reference](https://projectlombok.org/features/Builder)

## Why should we use Builder?
When there is more than 2 parameters in constructor, we recommend to use Builder pattern.

It provides readability and flexibility. Like some parameters can be null.
