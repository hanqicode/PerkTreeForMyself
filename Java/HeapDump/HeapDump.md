# HeapDump Summary

## What is HeapDump?
A heap dump is a snapshot of the memory of a Java process.

The snapshot contains information about the Java objects and classes in the heap at the moment the snapshot is triggered.

## How to do HeapDump?
Here we will use a tool named **VisualVM** to do it.

1. Download VisualVM from its home page.
2. `cd unzip_folder/bin` and `./visualvm` to open the application.
3. You can see the application in the left area.
