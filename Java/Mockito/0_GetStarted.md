# Get Started
[Mockito Framework Site](https://site.mockito.org/)

## Why
- mock dependencies
- readable tests
- clean verification errors

## How
```java
// you can mock concrete classes, not only interfaces
LinkedList mockedList = mock(LinkedList.class);

// stubbing appears before the actual execution
when(mockedList.get(0)).thenReturn("first");

// the following prints "first"
System.out.println(mockedList.get(0));

// the following prints "null" because get(999) was not stubbed
System.out.println(mockedList.get(999));
```
