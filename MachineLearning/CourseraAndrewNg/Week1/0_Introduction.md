# Introduction

## Definition
- Arthur Samuel(1959): Machine learing - Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Tom Mitchell(1998): A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Algorithms
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning

Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems.

## Supervised Learning

**Regression Problem**: Predict continuous valued output.

Say "right answers" are given, to predict new "right answers". 
E.g. given a list of (square feet, price) to predict the price of a new house with input sqaure feet.

**Classification Problem**: Discrete valued output(0 or 1).

Say predict breast cancer, then it only has two result: malignant or benign.
