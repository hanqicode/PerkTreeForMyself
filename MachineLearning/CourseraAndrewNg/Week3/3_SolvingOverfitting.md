# Solving the Problem of Overfitting

## The Problem of Overfitting
1. Underfitting / High bias: not fitting the training data very well;
2. Just right;
3. Overfitting / High variance: not a good hypothesis;

**Overfitting**: If we have too many features, the learned hypothesis may fit the training set very well, but fail to generalize to new examples.

**Address Overfitting**:
1. Reduce number of features.
2. Regularization: Keep all the features, but reduce magnitude/values of parameters.
