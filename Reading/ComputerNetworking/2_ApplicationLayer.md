# Application Layer

## Terminology

### Processes Communication
A **process** can be thought of as a program that is running within an end system.

1. On one host
When processes are running on the same end system, they can com- municate with each other with interprocess communication, using rules that are governed by the end systemâ€™s operating system.

2. On more hosts
Processes on two different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging messages across the computer network.

### Socket
A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a **socket**.

This is the interface between the application process and transport layer.

A process is analogous to a house and its socket is analogous to its door.

### Addressing Process
To identify the receiving process, two pieces of information need to be specified: 
1. the address of the host. (**IP address**)
2. an identifier that specifies the receiving process in the destination host. (**port number**)
