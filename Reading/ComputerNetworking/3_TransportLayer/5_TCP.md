# Connection-Oriented Transport: TCP

TCP: the Internetâ€™s transport-layer, connection-oriented, reliable transport protocol.

## How does TCP setup connection?

From client to server:
1. The client application process informs the client transport layer that it wants to establish a connection to a process in the server.
2. TCP in the client then proceeds to establish a TCP connection with TCP in the server. 
3. Client sends a TCP segment with no payload.
4. Server sends a TCP segment with no payload.
5. Client sends a TCP with payload.

Because three segments are sent between the two hosts, this connection-establishment procedure is often referred to as a **three-way handshake**.
