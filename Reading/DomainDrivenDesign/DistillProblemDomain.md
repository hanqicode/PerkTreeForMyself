# Distill The Problem Domain

## Knowledge crunching and Collaboration
1. We can start from a use case to understand the business requirements.
2. Need to collaborate with business experts/stakeholders to understand correctly and not overlooked.
3. Simplify the model to satisfy the needs of all use cases.

## Reach a shared understanding through a shared language
The language should also be used in the code implementation of the model, with the same terms and concepts used as class names, properties, and method names.

The shared understanding that a UL prevents the need to constantly translate from a technical model to a business model, thus removing the chance of vital insight being lost.

## An ongoing process
Knowledge crunching is an ongoing process; teams should continually be working toward a simple view of the problem domain that focuses only on the relevant pieces to aid the creation of a useful model. 

The model made is only useful for the problems at hand.

## Domain experts
Stakeholders may just give you the inputs, outputs of the system; Domain experts will give you a useful model to satisfy the needs.
