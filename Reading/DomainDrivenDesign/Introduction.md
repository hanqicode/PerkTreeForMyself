# Introduction

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a process that aligns your code with the reality of your problem domain.  
Personally, I think it tries to understand and solve the problem first, then choose reasonable and suitable tools, 
patterns, frameworks, etc.

> First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.

## Problem Space
Before you can develop a solution, you must understand the problem. 

DDD foucses on: 
1. buiness terminology
1. the core reasons behind why the software is being developed
1. what success means to the business
