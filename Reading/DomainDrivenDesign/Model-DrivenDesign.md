# Model-Driven Design

## What Is A Domain Model?
It is described in a shared language that the team speaks and the diagrams that the team sketches.
The model contains only what is relevant to solve problems in the context of the application being created.

## Domain VS Domain Model
**Domain**: the problem area you are working within. It is the firm reality of the situation.

**Domain Model**: is an abstraction of the problem domain. It is a view of the problem.

The domain model only exists to help us solve problems.  
In order to be effective it needs to have clarity and be free of technical complexities

## Collaborating On A Ubiquitous Language
These concepts must be named by the entire team and included in the shared UL.
The development team must use it in code, and the domain experts must use it when talking to the team.
The UL should be clear and concise.

## Best Practices for Shaping the Language
- Ensure that you use one word for a specific concept.
- Stay away from overloaded terms like *policy*, *service*, or *manager*. Be explicit even if it means being wordy.
- Naming is very important.
